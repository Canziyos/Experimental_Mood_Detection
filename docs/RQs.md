Decrease Diversity instead of only applying augmentation on same dataset. combining from different setup conditions,

hypothesis: would this approach increase the performance and generalization ability.
problem formulation: project desc, discussions + former prpjects datset-related limitions. 


1. What is the impact of dataset homogeneity vs. heterogeneity in terms of the performance and generalization of non-invasive mood detection systems?  

homogenity = acted vs. natrual or only different datasets can be considered heterogenous? what if both are acted.

2.  Can simplifying emotion labels into grouped categories (e.g., positive, neutral, negative) improve model accuracy and clinical usability in mood detection for dementia care?


in demenria care we care more about mood shifting to negative? is that related to emotion models, i.e., valence/arousal?
